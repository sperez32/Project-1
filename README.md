# Project-1

All original files that were originally HTML files were changed to ejs files but still retain the HTML. This was done to help with functionality of project as well as make different paths function throughout the project

To reach Admin Page of Project where you will be able to perform: Insert, Update, Delete, Search, and Display Operations primarily on the table that contains information for the Interest form. However, you are able to display all entities in both the Interest and Contact Forms.
